## Dashboard System for Bicycles

We developed a Dashboard system with Arduino boards for Bycicles that includes robust safety features to help cyclists safely bike in the city along with providing them with information about their navigation and health metrics. 
We used numerous external modules and wrote the code in C++. This project was done for a Computer Design course, in which it was a requirement that every group member have an Arduino board to communicate with each other. 
Despite this project's requirement, the wiring would be much simpler to have this use one Arduino board and a breadboard with a Serial Bus I2C Communication for all the modules. 


## Dashboard Features

- LED Turn Signals (Controlled with a Joystick)
- Speedometer 
- Heart Rate Sensor 
- Brightness Adjusting Headlight 


## Required Modules

- Pulse Sensor - SEN-11574
- Neo 6M GPS Module 
- Photoresistor 
- 8-count LED Strip
- Joystick 
- Optional:
- OLED and LCD screen (Can use both, likely only need one. Preferable a large OLED Screen)
