Dashboard System for Bycicles

We developed a Dashboard system with Arduino boards for Bycicles that includes robust safety features to help cyclists safely bike in the city along with providing them information about their navigation and health metrics. 
We used numerous exeternal modules and wrote the code in C++. This project was done for a Computer Design course in which there was a course requirment to have every group member's Arduino board to communicate with each other. 
Despite this project requirment, the wiring would be much simpler to have this use one Arduino board and a breadboard with a Serial Bus I2C Communication for all the modules.
